## Description
<!-- Please include SEO-friendly description -->

This supplementary material constitutes the artifact for our paper titled "On the Feasibility of Cross-Language Detection of Malicious Packages in npm and PyPI".
Specifically:
- `Labelled_Dataset.csv` (1.8MB in size): 
  - This file contains the labelled dataset used in our evaluation process. It houses the data employed for evaluating the features, assessing the models, and training the classifiers. Such dataset can be used to gain further insights into how features were selected, evaluate the models' performance, and comprehend the training process.
- `.pkl` Files (cross-language (125.9 kB), JavaScript mono-language (73.7 kB), and Python mono-language (110.1 kB)): 
  - These files, saved in pickle format, encapsulate the best-performing classifiers that emerged from our models' evaluation. They can be imported into Python using scikit-learn library. This feature enables you to use these classifiers for classification tasks.
- `Malicious_Packages_Discovered.csv`: 
  - This file comprises a comprehensive list of malicious packages that were successfully detected during our real-world experiment. It details their characteristics, behavior types, and obfuscation techniques.
- `scripts/*`:
  - This folder contains the scripts to reproduce the evaluation and training of the models presented in the paper

## Requirements and Run

(1) Install the dependencies via:

```
$ pip install -r ./scripts/requirements.txt
```

(2) Run the script according to the model you want to reproduce (i.e., cross-language or mono-language). For example, in the case of the cross-language XGBoost model you can run from the main folder:

```
$ python ./scripts/Crosslanguage_XGBoost_train_test.py
```

The produced classifier can be then imported in Python using the joblib function `load()`, for example:

```
classifier_XGBoost = joblib.load(model_path)
```

## Features Explaination

`Labelled_Dataset.csv` is a labeled dataset containing packages from two distinct public repositories: NPM and PyPI. It addresses the issue of classifying malicious packages, taking into account the imbalance problem.

In this scenario, we assume that the estimated percentage of malicious packages among all packages is approximately 10%.

It follows the explaination of the columns in the CSV file.

#### Package information

- `Malicious`: encodes the target value, i.e., wether a package is benign (value of 0)  or malicious (value of 1)	
- `Package Repository`: specifies from which package repository the package comes from (i.e., NPM or PyPI)
- `Package Name`: specifies the package name
